# Abstraction

This standard is an extension of ERC-721 and defines standard functions outlining a scope for creating and using coupon in the form of NFT. NFT coupon is a non-fungible token that has stamp receiving spaces. When the coupon fulfills the required stamps, the coupon can be consumed which means that coupon can take effect or action in real or digital world.

# Motivation

As attempts to integrate Web3 and real-world assets have been made repeatedly, there has been a demand for NFTs that can function as coupons. The advantage of an NFT coupon lies in its value, regardless of whether the user fulfills the required conditions, as it can be easily and securely exchanged. This not only benefits users but also companies offering membership benefits. For instance, in Korea, mobile carriers or card companies may offer perks like free coffee after a user visits Starbucks 10 times. However, users often find these membership benefits uncomfortable due to their inability to meet the requirements. Consequently, users miss out on membership benefits, and companies waste their budgets. NFT coupons offer a solution, as owners can sell their active coupons to those in need. Furthermore, NFT coupons are not limited to real-world assets but can also be applied to digital assets, such as the gaming industry.

To provide a digital coupon service, businesses need to develop applications that users can use. However, small companies find it difficult to develop digital coupon services. By utilizing NFT coupons on the blockchain, we can easily issue digital coupon services using a simple web UI that we provide, and users can freely use them wherever the internet is available.
